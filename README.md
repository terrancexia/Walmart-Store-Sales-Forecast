# Walmart-Store-Sales-Forecast

In this notebook I will use python 3 to analyze and predict the sales based on the data from Walmart. 

Datasets are provided by Walmart with 45 different stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments and we will need to project the sales for each department in each store.  Also the holidays markdown are included in the dataset as well. Data is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data
